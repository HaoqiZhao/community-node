Rewards Plan

Every day, 27 newly elected Super Representatives will alternate producing blocks at one per second rewarded with 32 TRX, or approximately 2,750,000 TRX per day and 100,000 TRX per Super Representative.


    Givens:
    100 Super Representative Candidates
    27  Block Producing Super Representatives per day
    32 TRX per block / 2.7 million TRX per day / 1 Billion TRX per year
    65 Billion TRX circulation
    $40,000 monthly cost of running a node

Without taking the cost of running the server into account, it may appear as though the absolute maximum reward for TRX voters is 1.5% annually, based on 1 Billion TRX rewards per 65 Billion TRX coins eligible to vote. Of course, with 100 candidates, not every vote will go toward a winning candidate, and votes that go to losing candidates will go unrewarded. 

One might think, then, that a node could meet expenses and still be able to offer a 2%-3% annual payout.

That is an erroneous conclusion. Because there's more. Much, much more.

What all the other token proposals have overlooked is that the actual rewards for the votes will be based on how many votes got that candidate elected. The daily payout of 100,000 TRX is a maximum regardless of how many votes elected that Super Representative. A Super Representative who has to reward 2 Billion votes will have a smaller reward than a Super Representative who is rewarding 500 million votes.

Let's say there are 15 whales who own half the TRX, or 30 Billion coins, leaving 35 Billion coins / votes for 12 remaining Super Representatives. But these will be the least reliable votes, and the votes of coins held on exchanges. Not every coin holder will bother to vote, and coins held on exchanges get voted by the exchange owners. 

What will the "little fish" participation rate be? 	For the purposes of this example I'll use a range of 25%-100%, and use 60% as my test case.

This gives us a range of 9-35 Billion votes split among the remaining competition of 85 candidates, or 100-400 million votes average. The 60% voter participation test case would have 240 million votes per candidate, give or take. Obviously the winning 12 Super Representatives will have more votes than the other candidates.

Remember my original calculation of 1.5% was based on splitting the 1 Billion rewards evenly over the 65 Billion TRX and 27 SRs, working out to 2.4 Billion rewardable votes per SR. Based on my test case, if the actual number of votes for the last winning SR is 240 million, then the payout would be 10 times 1.5% = 15% annual (gross before expenses). 

I expect there will be a strategy among TRX voters to try and vote for the last winning Super Representative since they will have the highest reward that day. Thus there will be an ebb and flow as the smaller 85 candidates fall in and out of favor.  It would be imprudent for us to assume that an earning position can be attained 365 days a year, even if we offer a more lucrative rewards plan than the competition.


The current proposal is to create a TGNT token. The value of TGNT will be priced in TRX and tethered to it in a 1:1 trading pair. Proceeds from the sale of TGNT will be held in escrow to maintain a liquid market. For every token issued, one TRX must be retained.

All operating expenses will come from the gross block earnings before rewards are met. Therefore TGNT shall not become diluted and will maintain its value of 1 TRX at all times, although demand for TGNT may warrant that it become decoupled from TRX and placed on an exchange. The current proposal is to issue 240 million TGNT to represent the estimated number of votes a Super Representative might need to win.


Our TGNT token will give the lion's share of our node's rewards to our token holders, on an equity based system. Those who get in earliest, and keep their TRX with us, will get the highest rewards. Newcomers to the token will be on a lower pay tier, and regular TRX holders who voted for us will be on the lowest tier, using a formula [similar to this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q2zNntZ7wF5Q9E2Eg1zrRR2Xsmku0GZR_cSFDVYdeI0/edit#gid=0)
