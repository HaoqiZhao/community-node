Rewards Plan


Every day, 27 newly elected Super Representatives will alternate producing blocks at one per second rewarded with 32 TRX, or approximately 2,750,000 TRX per day and 100,000 TRX per Super Representative.


The current proposal is to create a TGNT token. The value of TGNT will be priced in TRX and tethered to it in a 1:1 trading pair. Proceeds from the sale of TGNT will be held in escrow to maintain a liquid market. For every token issued, one TRX must be retained. Therefore TGNT shall not become diluted and will maintain its value of 1 TRX at all times. TGNT holders may divest at any time for at the same 1:1 ratio with TRX.

There will be no risk. No debt will be incurred, and the proceeds from TGNT will not go toward operating expenses. We don't want to use the equity of your TRX, we just want to manage your voting rights.

Ww will issue 500 million TGNT, which represents the estimated number of votes a Super Representative might need to win.

Our TGNT token will give our node's rewards to our token holders on a fidelity based system, using a formula [similar to this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q2zNntZ7wF5Q9E2Eg1zrRR2Xsmku0GZR_cSFDVYdeI0/edit#gid=0). Those who get in earliest, and keep their TRX with us, will get the highest rewards. Newcomers to the token will be on a lower pay tier. At the end of every quarter, we will begin a new tier for newcomers and current TGNT holders will ascend to the next rewards tier. 

How much will the reward be to the TGNT coin holders? That's the question everyone wants to know, but it's a difficult one to answer definitively.

This is a financially precarious proposition with TRX at .09¢, and when this plan was being devised the price of TRX was .05¢. Any forward looking statements have to take into account the possibility that the price of TRX could revert back to lower levels. 

We believe it would be dishonest to promise a set percentage reward our TGNT token holders because our expenses are in dollars and the rewards are paid in TRX. At the moment, TRX is .09¢ per coin, making the daily payout for a Super Representative node about $9,000. A Super Representative position needs to be won at least 5 times per month in order to break even. Since elections are daily, there is no guarantee that a Super Representative will get to keep its seat every day of the year.

Neither are we willing to write into our bylaws a rewards structure that guarantees a percentage for ourselves. Even if we were able to win a Super Representative position every day of the year, current expenses would be 15% of total rewards. On the other hand, if we were to apply an unhealthy amount of optimism and consider $400 per TRX, the node's monthly block rewards payout would be more than a billion dollars, and operating expenses would be less than 2%.

Without taking the cost of running the server into account, it may appear as though the absolute maximum reward for TRX voters is 1.5% annually, based on 1 Billion TRX rewards per 65 Billion TRX coins eligible to vote. Of course, with 100 candidates, not every vote will go toward a winning candidate, and votes that go to losing candidates will go unrewarded. 

One might think, then, that a node could meet expenses and still be able to offer a 2%-3% annual payout.

What all the other token proposals have overlooked is that the actual rewards for the votes will be based on how many votes got that candidate elected. The daily payout of 100,000 TRX is a maximum regardless of how many votes elected that Super Representative. A Super Representative who has to reward 2 Billion votes will have a smaller reward than a Super Representative who is rewarding 500 million votes.

    
    100 Super Representative Candidates
    27  Block Producing Super Representatives per day
    32 TRX per block / 2.7 million TRX per day / 1 Billion TRX per year
    65 Billion TRX circulation
    $40,000 monthly cost of running a node


For a dry run on some possible outcomes, let's say there are 15 whales who own half the TRX, or 30 Billion coins, leaving 35 Billion coins / votes for 12 remaining Super Representatives. But these will be the least reliable votes, and the votes of coins held on exchanges. Not every coin holder will bother to vote, and coins held on exchanges get voted by the exchange owners. 

What will the "little fish" participation rate be? 	For the purposes of this example I'll use a range of 25%-100%, and use 60% as my test case.

This gives us a range of 9-35 Billion votes split among the remaining competition of 85 candidates, or 100-400 million votes average. The 60% voter participation test case would have 240 million votes per candidate, give or take. Obviously the winning 12 Super Representatives will have more votes than the other candidates.

Remember my original calculation of 1.5% was based on splitting the 1 Billion rewards evenly over the 65 Billion TRX and 27 SRs, working out to 2.4 Billion rewardable votes per SR. Based on my test case, if the actual number of votes for the last winning SR is 240 million, then the payout would be 10 times 1.5% = 15% annual (gross before expenses). 

The biggest unknown in all of this is how many TRX votes the whales have locked up for themselves. If it's only 15 Billion among 22 whales, then there would be 50 Billion votes to be split between 78 remaining candidates, or about 50% more votes per candidate than with my original assumption. If they have 44 Billion votes between 20 of them, then the rest would be splitting 16 Billion votes between 80 candidates, or half as many votes per candidate than with my original assumption.





I expect there will be a strategy among TRX voters to try and vote for the last winning Super Representative since they will have the highest reward that day. Thus there will be an ebb and flow as the smaller 85 candidates fall in and out of favor.  It would be imprudent for us to assume that an earning position can be attained 365 days a year, even if we offer a more generous rewards plan than the competition.




As expenses are met, rewards will increase until the commencement of Stage II: The server's technical migration to 16, 32, and finally 64 Core server that meets Tron's recommended configuration to put my node on a level with the top of the heap, at which point expenses will plateau and rewards become consistent.
