This node is starting off in the Linode cloud to alleviate the vulnerability of having too many nodes hosted on AWS, 
eventually migrating to a Rackspace managed OnMetal server. No additional VM software or containerization overhead needs 
to be added since this is a dedicated server.

Next build out will split off http and add exim mail & dns services to a small slice nanode VM, and also provide a testable node for community members.
