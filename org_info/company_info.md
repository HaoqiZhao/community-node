###Corporate Bios###

> CTO - [Jason Neely](./jason_neely.jpg) has maintained a unix server almost constantly since 1998 when he installed QTSS on his iMac. Soon after, he began work as an Apple Retail Representative, then went on to be a Tier 2 technician for Darwin Networks where he became Cisco certified. After the dot com bust he worked on the U.S. Congressional campaign of Andrew Horne, first as a volunteer who maintained the website and broadcasted emails, eventually writing copy and working directly with the communications team in a salaried position. From there, he formed Campaign Kickstart, a grassroots incubator, and developed an advocacy program for the Louisville Affordable Housing Trust Fund's Open the Door campaign. For the past 10 years he has been studying OOP and considers himself to be one of the last few Ruby on Rails enthusiasts.
