• Jason Neely has been maintaining a unix server almost constantly since 1998 when he began work as an Apple Retail Representative and installed RedHat on his iMac. He then went on to be a Tier 2 technician for Darwin Networks, and after the dot.com bust he found work on political and advocacy campaigns including the Louisville Affordable Housing Trust Fund's Open the Door campaign. He is still one of the last few Ruby on Rails enthusiasts.
