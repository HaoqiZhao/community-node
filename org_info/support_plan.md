• CTO - Jason Neely has been maintaining a unix server almost constantly since 1998 when he began work as an Apple 
Retail Representative and installed RedHat on his iMac. He then went on to be a Tier 2 technician for Darwin 
Networks, and after the dot.com bust he found work on political and advocacy campaigns including the Louisville 
Affordable Housing Trust Fund's Open the Door campaign. He is still one of the last few Ruby on Rails enthusiasts.
