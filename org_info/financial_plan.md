Business Plan / Financial Plan

This organization will expand from just one person to many. During this transition there will be several challenges as I increase the scale of these activities.

I currently bear the sole expense of the server and will stake all coins needed to apply as a witness node. In the event that I become a witness node I will continue to pay for all expenses up through the Level I Super Representative server configuration. 

As a Super Representative, the node will be earning enough to pay for itself and all intended upgrades.

At this point I believe an investment on infrastructure will return a greater participation as a block creating node, and I will launch a TRX-20 based token.

## N.B. the exact numbers of this ICO proposal are not set and are sure to change.

The current proposal is to create a TGNT token with 3,700,000 coins authorized. It will have a 1:1 ratio to the TRX coin. 500,000 coins will be offered during the ICO. The remaining coins will be used to pay employees of the organization. 

There will be a need for several part-time employees who will also earn TRX and tokens. 

The commencement of TGNT will signal the end of my individual ownership where all liabilities and equities are passed on to the organization. As part of the new entity's formation these assets will be sold to the TGNT organization in exchange for 300,000 TGNT tokens. My salary as CTO will be 500,000 TGNT annually.
 
If 27 Super Representatives  each kept 2% of approximately $40,000,000 per year in daily rewards,it would not even meet the cost of running the server. Now consider that only a few of the SRs will be voted in every day of the year, but that all of the candidates must maintain a server 365. Clearly, this is not a get-rich-quick proposal. Then again, TRX was .30Â¢ for a fleeting moment and if it could sustain those levels it would change the financial viability of this proposal.

The ill fated endeavor Bitconnect offers some warnings about potential pitfalls. First and foremost, this is not an investment opportunity. TRX is the real investment. TGNT is a management opportunity. Secondly, the TGNT needs to preserve the value of our assets and guarantee that we possess one TRX for every TGNT sold to the public.
