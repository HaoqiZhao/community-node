Rewards Plan

In regards to a recent question about Community Node's rewards proposal, the TL;DR is we think rewards are the easy way to get elected, as well as the quickest way to disappoint everyone and go under.

The actual rewards plan depends on how many votes are required to win a Super Representative spot, and whether we get elected as Super Representative node full time or just part time.

Everyone else's plan uses full-time as a given. We think that is an irrational assumption.

Because the reward is what's left over after expenses are met, part time status severely limits the reward. We are afraid that after attaining part time SR status, a significant achievement, we will lose our support due to disappointing the voters who had built up unrealistic expectations about quick returns based upon the certainty that every day will provide 1/365th of the Super Representative's annual gross revenue. 

Our business plan is built around the contingency that we may not get elected as SR every day, or even for some time. Others may get elected on day one, but once they fail to get elected their rewards program will break down as they start to lower the reward to make up for lost revenue. Instead of gaining momentum, we foresee a catastrophic exodus of support from these programs who overpromised rewards for votes.

Therefore we wish to peg our initial benefit to the community to the services we can offer. This will build up concrete expectations which are achievable even on a part time status. 

After the launch of the Tron main net Super Representative elections, we will issue a TRX tethered "Tron Groupsource Node Token" which will function in several ways. 

We will exchange the TGNT for TRX, and freeze the TRX to lock in votes. One of our daily administrative duties will be to maintain these voting rights by re-freezing TRX as needed. We will then determine an optimal rotation schedule whereby a sufficient number of TRX are always available for unfreezing for TGNT by members seeking to divest. This will provide the best of both worlds to Tronix coin holders - liquidity and voting rights.

Another feature TGNT will provide is a tiered rewards system based on fidelity, or length of investment, giving the earliest supporters a higher rate of return than more recent community members. This will discourage divestment and limit the number of TRX we need to keep liquid. We are listening to proposed ratios of return for top tier vs. bottom tier and will solidify our ideas after we've gotten some feedback.

The daily rewards payout for the TGNT tokenbase will be based on 30 day aggregates of income and expenses, and calculated using 30 day moving average of daily votes received. This will give us a guaranteed, advertisable rate for the next day and a limited variation over the next 30 days. 

No rewards will be given to regular TRX holders who cast votes for us. They will benefit from our hard work for the community. 

During our campaign for Super Represenative, we will be calculating a minimum and a maximum payout, and we may need to wait until after round one of mock voting is completed before being able to gauge the necessary number of votes, and therefore the number of TGNT issued to safely hold our seat.

Over time TGNT may sponsor other blockchain programs which will accrue value for long term holders.
