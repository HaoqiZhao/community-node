Rewards Plan

In regards to a recent question about Community Node's rewards proposal, the TL;DR is we think rewards are the easy way to get elected, as well as the quickest way to disappoint everyone and go under.

The actual rewards plan depends on how many votes are required to win a Super Representative spot, and whether we get elected as Super Representative node full time or just part time.

Everyone else's plan uses full-time as a given. We think that is an irrational assumption.

Because the reward is what's left over after expenses are met, part time status severely limits the reward. We are afraid that after attaining part time SR status, a significant achievement, we will lose our support due to disappointing the voters who had built up unrealistic expectations about quick returns based upon the certainty that every day will provide 1/365th of the Super Representative's annual gross revenue. 

Our business plan is built around the contingency that we may not get elected as SR every day, or even for some time. Others may get elected on day one, but once they fail to get elected their rewards program will break down as they start to lower the reward to make up for lost revenue. Instead of gaining momentum, we foresee a catastrophic exodus of support from these programs who overpromised rewards for votes.

Therefore we wish to peg our initial benefit to the community to the services we can offer. This will build up concrete expectations which are achievable even on a part time status. 

The daily rewards payout will be based on 30 day averages of votes, income, and expenses.  The 30 day average for votes will be recalculated daily; average income and expenses will be recalculated weekly. 

Rewards per vote will be calculated using the following formula:


N = number of days address has voted for community node (minimum 1000 votes cast each day)  
F = Fidelity. N divided by 2000, plus one, squared.  
F = [(1 + N/2000) ^ 2]  

V = Votes cast for us today by this address  
W = F x V  
W = Weighted vote obligation  

D = W x R  
D = Daily reward per voting address  

D = (total daily payout / total daily votes )  * Address Votes * [(1 + N/2000) ^ 2]

For example, if we get elected as SR every day of the month, revenues are approximately 3.4 million TRX and expenses are approximately 600,000 TRX, for a rewards pool of 2.8 million TRX.  

If the average is 100 million votes per day: 

Dividing the monthly payout by the monthly votes, we get the rewards multiplier, R = 0.0009333

On the first day someone votes for us, they start with a Fidelity of 1 because the number of days they have voted for us is zero, which divided by 2000 is zero, added to one is one, and squared is still one. Multiply one times the monthly payout and divide by the monthly votes, they will get paid 0.0009333 per vote, which works out to 34.05% annual yield.

On the second day that they vote for us, that person's fidelity becomes 1.001, which multiplied times the number of votes gives the organization's weighted vote obligation to that person. This person will get paid 1.001 x 0.000933 or 0.0009339 per vote, equal to 34.08% annual.

On this second day, some voters will get paid 0.0009333 per vote and some will get 0.0009339 per vote depending on whether they voted for us the day before too. If half the voters have a fidelity of 1.001, the second day's rewards will be 100,025 TRX. 

We must reduce daily payout to stay within the limits of the reward pool. 0.999750062484379

As the fidelity rewards grow, the base rate will decrease by an equal amount.  The final formula becomes the Sum of all the individual daily payouts divided by the actual rewardable amount, multiplied by the previous days rewards multiplier.

On the third day, the rate will be 100000 / 100025 x 0.0009333 = 0.0009331

To give you an idea of the value of the equity, a community node supporter who votes for us during the first 200 days will end up getting about 20% higher payout than a newcomer. After 400 days it will be 45% more. After 800 days it will be more than twice the introductory rate.

One of our aims is to create stability within the organization and consistency around the rewards payout. 

To further this aim, we will limit the reward as operating expenses are gradually met. 90% of first day rewards will be retained, with 10% less taken each day until only 10% of the rewards are retained. This will continue until 30 days of rewards have been banked.

Keeping a 30 day payout reserve will let us increase the stability of the investment by issuing rewards regardless of whether we win the SR election that day, or not. 

Then, we can give a guaranteed, advertised rate of return recalculated daily. And since the reward is based on the 30 day moving average of votes cast, the daily fluctuation will be minimal. 

In essence, we would create a market for buying votes instead of rewarding them.
