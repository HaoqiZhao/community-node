Rewards Plan

In regards to a recent question about Community Node's rewards proposal, the TL;DR is we think rewards are the easy way to get elected, as well as the quickest way to disappoint everyone and go under.

The actual rewards plan depends on how many votes are required to win a Super Representative spot, and whether we get elected as Super Representative node full time or just part time.

Everyone else's plan uses full-time as a given. We think that is an irrational assumption.

Because the reward is what's left over after expenses are met, part time status severely limits the reward. We are afraid that after attaining part time SR status, a significant achievement, we will lose our support due to disappointing the voters who had built up unrealistic expectations about quick returns based upon the certainty that every day will provide 1/365th of the Super Representative's annual gross revenue. 

Our business plan is built around the contingency that we may not get elected as SR every day, or even for some time. Others may get elected on day one, but once they fail to get elected their rewards program will break down as they start to lower the reward to make up for lost revenue. Instead of gaining momentum, we foresee a catastrophic exodus of support from these programs who overpromised rewards for votes.

Therefore we wish to peg our initial benefit to the community to the services we can offer. This will build up concrete expectations which are achievable even on a part time status. 

During our campaign for Super Represenative, we will be calculating a minimum and a maximum payout, and we may need to wait until after round one of mock voting is completed before being able to gauge the necessary number of votes, and therefore the number of TGNT issued to safely hold our seat.

The daily rewards payout will be based on 30 day aggregates of income and expenses, and calculated using 30 day moving average of daily votes received. This will give us a guaranteed, advertisable rate for the next day and a limited variation over the next 30 days. 

The rewards system needs 30 days of data and revenue before the rewards function can begin. The 31st day will be considered day one for rewards, using the following formula:


V = Votes cast for us today by this address 
N = number of days address has voted for community node (minimum 1000 votes cast each day)

F = Fidelity. N divided by 200, plus one, squared.
F = [(1 + N/200) ^ 2]

W = Weighted vote obligation
W = F x V

R = Reward multiplier per vote. (daily payout / daily votes )
D = Daily reward per voting address

D = W x R

For example, if we get elected as SR with an average of 100 million votes per day, (3 trillion monthly votes), and are able to maintain that SR position for the full 30 days, after one month the rewards would look like this:

Monthly revenues are approximately 3.4 million TRX and expenses are approximately 600,000 TRX, for a net of 2.8 million TRX. Dividing the monthly payout by the monthly votes, we get the rewards multiplier, R = 0.000933

On the first day of rewards, everyone starts with a Fidelity of 1 because the number of days they have voted for us is zero, which divided by 200 is zero, added to one is one, and squared is still one. They will get paid 0.000933 per vote.

On the second day of rewards, that person's fidelity becomes 1.010025, which multiplied times the number of votes gives the organization's weighted vote obligation to that person.

On this second day, some voters will have the new fidelity number, but some will be first time voters and have an introductory fidelity of 1. So if half the voters had a N = 1 the average obligation would be 1.005. We must account for this augmentation to the rewards payout, and reduce the reward multiplier on day 3 by an equal amount. On day 3 the rewards multiplier will be 99.5% of the previous day's number, so instead of being 0.000933 it will be 0.000926

Based on 100 Million votes per day, the introductory return will be 3.5% annual.

The Fidelity formula may need to be tweaked so as not to grow exponentially large too quickly.
