TRON Groupsource Node Token (TGNT)

On May 1, 2018, Tron Labs will launch the Tron main net. The blockchain will be supported by nodes, and 27 of those nodes will be elected daily to be Super Representative Witness Nodes. 

Every day these 27 Super Representatives will vie for block rewards of 32 TRX per second, or a little more than 2,750,000 TRX per day at an average of about 100,000 TRX per Super Representative. The daily payout is delegated to the 27 Super Representatives for vote based rewards. In other words, the Super Representatives will earn TRX daily, but in order to maintain elected power those Super Representatives must reward the TRX holders who voted for them. 

I am running a cloud based node with a focus on uptime and reliability. I hope to meet the performance levels sufficient to get my node voted into the group of candidates for Super Representative, after which the node may or may not enter rotation as an earning Super Representative. Originally I had welcomed the notion of taking a seat at the table next to other members of the TRON community, then I realized there won't be room for even one of us. 

And then... it hit me.

Since a TRON Network Super Representative is actually a collection of people backed by an organization, I wonder "what if the members of the Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube community banded together to become a Super Representative?" There won't be a seat at the table for any one of us, but perhaps there's one for all of us. Alone we each stand zero chance of winning an election, but together we can vote ourselves in.

I have heard that other PoS based coins have Super Representatives who end up keeping a small percentage of the daily payout. Before any quick calculations are done, first consider that there are 1 Billion TRX rewards to be distributed among the 65 Billion TRX coins every year. A TRX holder who faithfully votes every single day, and who successfully casts every vote for a winning Super Representative, might be able to earn 1.5% annually. But the voter participation rate will not be 100% among the 65 Billion TRX coin holders. Even for the TRON fanatics, voting every day will become tedious. Additionally, votes for candidates who did not win a Super Representative position will go unrewarded, leaving on the table extra rewards for the winning votes. I.e. if an election has a 33% participation rate, then the rewards per vote should be 3x more than if there was 100% participation. A Super Representative might be able to pay its voters 2% or even 3% annual rate and still have quite a bit left over.

It might be easier, and more lucrative, for some TRX holders to delegate their votes to an organization who will diligently claim rewards for them by voting daily. 

My proposal is to create a TRX-20 token, the TRON Groupsource Node Token (TGNT).

The purpose of TGNT is two fold. First, it accrues TRX coins and subsequently locks in those votes for Super Representative, sparing those TRX owners the need to vote for Super Representative every day. It also gives TRX coin holders a chance to participate in the management of the TRON network. Ownership of TGNT will provide an opportunity for TRX holders to have direct representation with TRON proper. TGNT holders will vote on the issues put forth to their TRON Super Representative, making the process truly democratic.

It is not my intention to have all of the TGNT supporters replace their TRX coins, but instead to give a vast number of TRX advocates a reason to prefer one Super Representative candidate over another. By giving TRX holders a stake in my node they will be more likely to vote for that node.

The value of TGNT will be priced in TRX and tethered to it in a 1:1 trading pair. Proceeds from the sale of TGNT will be held in escrow to maintain a liquid market.

As principals of the TGNT organization, TGNT owners will have voting rights. The primary question for token referendums will be the amount of rewards to be shared with TRX holders who voted for this node as Super Representative. While TGNT tokens each represent 1 TRX held in escrow by the organization, and hence one rewarded vote, TGNT will receive a slightly higher payout as it also includes the 2% Super Representative owner's share. 

TGNT will empower token holders with more than just the management of the organization. One of the roles of Super Representative will be 

>To Influence Up to Date and Applicable Business Direction Decisions

Questions facing the Super Representative could be:

> Ecosystem fee and block verification processes  
> Possible Project Partners or Vote for Partnership  
> Intended Market Demographics, Industries for Expansion    
> Changes to Protocol Specific Policy, Procedure or Technology    
> Updates or Creation of Bounties, Campaigns or Incentives  
  

Management of the server will begin as a volunteer position and will initially be left to me. I will accept open source contributions, because I know what I'm doing but I don't know everything. There will be a board of directors and a clear line of succession for system administrators. A dead man's switch will be set so if I fail to login for a predetermined length of time (think a week or so) then the #2 will gain my ssh private key and other pertinent admin info. This will be a 24/7/365 full time job and pay ought to be commensurate with the growing responsibility, and will be provided in TGNT. 

Should the server node be selected as a Super Representative, I will resize the VM to a more robust configuration for as long as it is an earning witness node.

If the server is able to complete just 0.4% of that day's blocks, or 10% of the average, just one day of earning would fund a month at my proposed Level III configuration, thus making the server financially self sufficient. No operating expenses will be paid from ICO proceeds.

I am paying out of pocket for the server's introductory level operation. Increased costs will be borne by Super Representative rewards. The cost of running the server for two months will be subtracted from Super Representative rewards before any rewards are paid out to voters.

As expenses are met, rewards will increase until the commencement of Stage II: The server's technical migration to 16, 32, and finally 64 Core server that meets Tron's recommended configuration to put my node on a level with the top of the heap, at which point expenses will plateau and rewards become consistent.

Token holders will participate in quarterly elections to select corporate officers and the lead project admin who is currently me. So if the organization wants to pull an Apple computer on my ass and say that the guy who built it sucks and you think you can do better, then I can be voted out. Hopefully by that time I will have earned enough tokens that my residual income makes all of my setup effort worthwhile.

Eventually TGNT will become diluted from the issuance of staff salaries. However TGNT holders will always receive a greater reward than the TRX voters who voted for this Super Representative.
