TRON Community Super Representative and Node

Since a Super Representative is actually a collection of people backed by an organization, I thought "what if the members of the Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube community banded together to become a SR Organization?" There won't be a seat at the table for any one of us, but perhaps there's one for all of us. Alone we each stand zero chance of winning an election, but together we can vote ourselves in.

I will be running a cloud based MainNet node from day one, starting with a 2 Core VM. My goal is uptime and reliability. If there is enough support for my idea I will start a dapp based token with 10,000 TRX. Community members who wish to take on the responsibilities of management can purchase dapp tokens for voting rights. The primary question for token elections will be the amount of TRX rewards payout to be shared with TRX holders who voted for this node as Super Representative. 

The proceeds from the sale of tokens will be used as a reserve to fund a scale-out in the event that our node becomes a Super Representative. Currently the cost of running the node is $20 per month. The server will migrate up one level after Candidacy has been reached, and again a second level up if elected to be one of the 27 Super Representatives.

Of paramount importance is completing Stage I of our technical migration to a 16 CPU VM. The cost of running the server for two months will be subtracted from Super Representative rewards before any token based, or vote based rewards distributions shall occur.

The scale-out of the server will increase with its participation as an earning Super Representative. 

Management of the server will initially be left to me and I will document the server build to accept open source contributions, because I know what I'm doing but I don't know everything. There will be a board of directors and a clear line of succession for system administrators. A dead man's switch will be set so if I fail to login for a predetermined length of time (think a week or so) then the #2 will gain my ssh private key and other pertinent admin info. This will be a 24/7/365 full time job and pay ought to be commensurate with the growing responsibility, and will be provided in both TRX coins and dapp tokens. It will begin as a volunteer position.

I will start hosting the project as beans.bondibox.com and upon token creation buy an appropriately named domain. The website will begin as a node.js API because this will have the smallest footprint, it's fast, and will be the easiest to turn into a TRON main net dapp. I'd like to redirect ERROR level log warnings to the website to provide a System Status page.

There will be a need for several part-time employees of the organization who will also earn TRX and dapp tokens. 

Token holders will participate in quarterly elections to select corporate officers and the lead project admin who is currently me. So if the organization wants to pull an Apple computer on my ass and say that the guy who built it sucks and you think you can do better, then I can be voted out. Hopefully by that time I will have earned enough dapp tokens that my residual income makes all of my setup effort worthwhile.

Every day the network will generate a little more than 2,750,000 TRX in payouts. That's about a billion TRX per year. The daily payout will be delegated to the 27 Super Representatives for vote based rewards. In other words, the Super Representatives will earn TRX daily, but in order to maintain elected power those Super Representatives must reward the TRX holders who voted for them. They say the other coins' SR's end up keeping about 1%-2% of the daily payout.

At today's value of appx .04¢ per TRX, there will be approximately $110,000 in daily rewards up for stake, or $40 million per year. 2% would be about $2200 a day, and split between the 27 Super Representatives, it comes to an average of $30,000 per year per SR. The recommended AWS cloud server config costs $40,000 per year.

Now consider that only a few of the SRs will be voted in every day of the year, but that all of the candidates must maintain a server 365. Clearly, this is not a get-rich-quick proposal. Then again, TRX was .30¢ for a fleeting moment and if it could sustain those levels it would change the financial viability of this proposal.

That being said, the TRX Community Token is not an investment opportunity. 98% of the earned rewards will be rewarded to TRX voters who maintain our position as an earning Super Representative. TRX is the real investment. A TRX holder who faithfully votes every single day, and who successfully spends every vote on winning Super Representatives can earn at most 1% annually. 

The goal of TRX Community Token is to create a broad base of support among TRX coin holders who wish to wield their inherent right to participate in the management of the TRON network. Our intention is to become self-empowering; that by giving TRX holders a stake in one of the candidates they will be more likely to vote for that candidate.
