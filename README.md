TRON Community Super Representative and Node

Since a Super Representative is actually a collection of people backed by an organization, I thought "what if the members of the Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube community banded together to become a SR Organization?" There won't be a seat at the table for any of us, but perhaps there's one for all of us. Alone we stand zero chance of winning an election, but together we can vote ourselves in.

I will be running a main.net node from day one, on just a small VM slice. My goal is uptime and reliability. If there is enough support for my idea I will start a dapp based token with 10,000 TRX. Community members can purchase these tokens with TRX to buy an owner's stake in the SR node's daily rewards, which will be split with TRX holders who voted for this node as Super Representative. How much more the owners get will be voted upon by token holders Board of Directors.

The proceeds from the sale of tokens will be used as a reserve to fund a scale-out in the event that our node becomes a Super Representative Candidate. The scale-out of the server will increase with its participation as an earning Super Representative. After the equivalent dollar value of 10000 TRX has been spent another round of tokens may be issued under a similar contract.

Management of the server will initially be left to me and I will document the server build to accept open source contributions, because I know what I'm doing but I don't know everything. There will be a board of directors and a clear line of succession for system administrators. A dead man's switch will be set so if I fail to login for a predetermined length of time (think a week or so) then the #2 will gain my ssh private key and other pertinent admin info. This will be a 24/7/365 full time job and pay ought to be commensurate with the growing responsibility, and will be provided in both TRX coins and dapp tokens. It will begin as a volunteer position.

I will start the project as beans.bondibox.com and upon token creation buy an appropriately named domain. The website will begin as a node.js API because this will have the smallest footprint, it's fast, and will be the easiest to turn into a TRON main net dapp. I'd like to redirect ERROR level log warnings to the website to provide a System Status page.

There will be a need for several part-time employees of the organization who will also earn TRX and dapp tokens. 

Token holders will participate in quarterly elections to select members of the board of directors and the lead project admin who is currently me. So if the organization wants to pull an Apple computer on my ass and say that the guy who built it sucks and you think you can do better, then I can be voted out. Hopefully by that time I will have earned enough dapp tokens that my residual income makes all of my setup effort worthwhile.

Every day the network will generate a little more than 2,750,000 TRX in payouts or $110,000 by today's value of appx .04¢ per TRX. That's a little more than a billion TRX per year, worth $40 million. The daily payout will be delegated to the 27 Super Representatives for vote based rewards. They say the other coins' SR's end up keeping about 1%-2% of the daily payout so call it $2000 a day, or an average of $30,000 per year per SR. The recommended AWS cloud server config costs $40,000 per year.

Now consider that only a few of the SRs will be voted in every day of the year, but that all of the candidates must maintain a server 365. Clearly, this is not a get-rich-quick proposal. Then again, TRX was .30¢ for a fleeting moment and if it could sustain those levels the financial dynamics of this proposal swing hard the other way.
