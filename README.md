TRON Groupsource Node Token ($TGNT)  Organizational / Support Plan

Since a TRON Network Super Representative is actually a collection of people backed by an organization, I wonder "what if the members of the Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube community banded together to become a Super Representative Organization?" There won't be a seat at the table for any one of us, but perhaps there's one for all of us. Alone we each stand zero chance of winning an election, but together we can vote ourselves in.

I will be running a cloud based MainNet node from day one, starting with a 2 Core VM. My goal is uptime and reliability. I hope to meet the performance levels sufficient to get my node voted into the group of candidates for Super Representative, after which the node may or may not enter rotation as an earning Super Representative. The average daily earnings for a Super Representative node is about 100,000 TRX. If even 10% of that goal is met it would fund an upgraded server that meets Tron's recommended configuration and put my node on a level with the top of the heap.

Of paramount importance is completing Stage I of the server's technical migration to a 16 Core VM. The cost of running the server for two months will be subtracted from Super Representative rewards before any rewards distributions shall occur.

The one thing that my business plan is missing is the ability to consistently win the daily election as Super Representative. I'm just a guy with a small stake and a node. No one has any incentive to vote for me. What I need to do is give TRX holders a stake in one of the nodes, and then they will be more likely to vote for that node.

This proposal is to create a TRX-20 token, the TRON Groupsource Node Token ($TGNT) at a 1:1 ratio with TRX. The TRX acquired will go toward increasing the node's stake and guaranteeing the daily exercising of those votes.

Approximately 98% of the rewards earned by the Super Representative node will be distributed to the TRX voters who maintain our position as an earning Super Representative as per the industry standard. A TRX holder who faithfully votes every single day, and who successfully spends every vote on winning Super Representatives might be able to earn 2% annually. 

But I wonder, what if the voter participation rate is less than 100% among the 65 Billion TRX coin holders? Even for the TRON fanatics, voting every day will become tedious. Additionally votes will be 'wasted' on candidates who did not win a Super Representative position. Many if not most TRX coins will be unrewarded, leaving on the table extra rewards for the people who did participate. A Super Representative might be able to pay its voters 2% or even 3% annual rate and still have quite a bit left over.

Because of these lost rewards, it might be easier for a TRX holder to delegate his votes to an organization who will be diligent in casting daily votes. The TGNT Organization offers the TRX community that opportunity.

As principals of the TGNT organization $TGNT owners will have voting rights on issues pertaining to the running of the organization. The primary question for token referendums will be the amount of rewards to be shared with TRX holders who voted for this node as Super Representative.

$TGNT will empower token holders with more than just the management of the organization. One of the roles of Super Representative will be 

> To Influence Up to Date and Applicable Business Direction Decisions

The goal of $TGNT is to create a broad base of support among TRX coin holders who wish to wield their inherent right to participate in the management of the TRON network. Ownership of $TGNT will provide an opportunity for TRX holders to have direct representation with TRON proper. Having #TGNT holders vote on the issues put forth to their TRON Super Representative makes the decision making process truly decentralized.

Management of the server will initially be left to me and I will document the server build to accept open source contributions, because I know what I'm doing but I don't know everything. There will be a board of directors and a clear line of succession for system administrators. A dead man's switch will be set so if I fail to login for a predetermined length of time (think a week or so) then the #2 will gain my ssh private key and other pertinent admin info. This will be a 24/7/365 full time job and pay ought to be commensurate with the growing responsibility, and will be provided in both TRX coins and tokens. It will begin as a volunteer position.

Token holders will participate in quarterly elections to select corporate officers and the lead project admin who is currently me. So if the organization wants to pull an Apple computer on my ass and say that the guy who built it sucks and you think you can do better, then I can be voted out. Hopefully by that time I will have earned enough tokens that my residual income makes all of my setup effort worthwhile.
