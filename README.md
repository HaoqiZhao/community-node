TRON Groupsource Node Token (TGNT)  Organizational / Support Plan

Since a TRON Network Super Representative is actually a collection of people backed by an organization, I wonder "what if the members of the Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube community banded together to become a Super Representative?" There won't be a seat at the table for any one of us, but perhaps there's one for all of us. Alone we each stand zero chance of winning an election, but together we can vote ourselves in.

I will be running a cloud based MainNet node from day one, starting with a 2 Core VM with a focus on uptime and reliability. I hope to meet the performance levels sufficient to get my node voted into the group of candidates for Super Representative, after which the node may or may not enter rotation as an earning Super Representative. 

Of paramount importance is completing Stage I of the server's technical migration to a 16 Core VM. The cost of running the server for two months will be subtracted from Super Representative rewards before any rewards distributions shall occur. If the server is able to complete just 0.4% of that day's blocks, or 10% of the average, just one day of earning would fund a month at my proposed Level III configuration. 

Rewards will increase until Stage II configurations have begun, wherein I am running a server that meets Tron's recommended configuration to put my node on a level with the top of the heap.

Every day 27 elected Super Representatives will vie for block rewards of 32 TRX per second, or a little more than 2,750,000 TRX per day and an average of about 100,000 TRX per Super Representative. The daily payout is delegated to the 27 Super Representatives for vote based rewards. In other words, the Super Representatives will earn TRX daily, but in order to maintain elected power those Super Representatives must reward the TRX holders who voted for them. Approximately 98% of the rewards earned by the Super Representative node will be distributed to the TRX voters who maintain our position as an earning Super Representative as per the industry standard. 

There are 1 Billion TRX rewards to be distributed among the 65 Billion TRX coins every year. A TRX holder who faithfully votes every single day, and who successfully spends every vote on winning Super Representatives might be able to earn 1.5% annually. 

The one thing that my business plan is missing is the ability to consistently win the daily election as Super Representative. I'm just a guy with a small node. No one has any incentive to vote for me. But if I give TRX holders a stake in my node they will be more likely to vote for that node.

My proposal is to create a TRX-20 token, the TRON Groupsource Node Token (TGNT), available to all members of the Tron/TRX community.

As principals of the TGNT organization TGNT owners will have voting rights. The primary question for token referendums will be the amount of rewards to be shared with TRX holders who voted for this node as Super Representative.

TGNT will empower token holders with more than just the management of the organization. The goal of TGNT is to create a broad base of support among TRX coin holders who wish to wield their inherent right to participate in the management of the TRON network. One of the roles of Super Representative will be 

>To Influence Up to Date and Applicable Business Direction Decisions
>
> Ecosystem fee and block verification processes  
> Possible Project Partners or Vote for Partnership  
> Intended Market Demographics, Industries for Expansion    
> Changes to Protocol Specific Policy, Procedure or Technology    
> Updates or Creation of Bounties, Campaigns or Incentives  
  
Ownership of TGNT will provide an opportunity for TRX holders to have direct representation with TRON proper. TGNT holders will vote on the issues put forth to their TRON Super Representative, making the process truly democratic.

I have heard that other PoS based coins have Super Representatives who end up keeping just a tiny fraction of the daily payout. Before any quick calculations are done, first consider that the voter participation rate will not be 100% among the 65 Billion TRX coin holders. Even for the TRON fanatics, voting every day will become tedious. Additionally votes will be 'wasted' on candidates who did not win a Super Representative position. This will result in many TRX coins going unrewarded, leaving on the table extra rewards for the people who did participate. A Super Representative might be able to pay its voters 2% or even 3% annual rate and still have quite a bit left over.

Because of these lost rewards, it might be easier for some TRX holders to delegate their votes to an organization who will be diligent in casting the daily votes for Super Representative. The TGNT Organization offers the TRX community that opportunity.

Management of the server will initially be left to me and I will document the server build to accept open source contributions, because I know what I'm doing but I don't know everything. There will be a board of directors and a clear line of succession for system administrators. A dead man's switch will be set so if I fail to login for a predetermined length of time (think a week or so) then the #2 will gain my ssh private key and other pertinent admin info. This will be a 24/7/365 full time job and pay ought to be commensurate with the growing responsibility, and will be provided in both TRX coins and tokens. It will begin as a volunteer position.

Token holders will participate in quarterly elections to select corporate officers and the lead project admin who is currently me. So if the organization wants to pull an Apple computer on my ass and say that the guy who built it sucks and you think you can do better, then I can be voted out. Hopefully by that time I will have earned enough tokens that my residual income makes all of my setup effort worthwhile.
