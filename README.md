TRON Groupsource Node Token (TGNT)

On May 1, 2018, Tron Labs will launch the Tron main net. The blockchain will be supported by nodes, and 27 of those nodes will be elected daily to be Super Representative Witness Nodes. 

I am running a cloud based node with a focus on uptime and reliability. I hope to meet the performance levels sufficient to get my node voted into the group of candidates for Super Representative, after which the node may or may not enter rotation as an earning Super Representative. 

Originally I had welcomed the notion of taking a seat at the table next to other members of the TRON community, then I realized there probably won't be room for even one of us. 

And then... it hit me.

Since a TRON Network Super Representative is actually a collection of people backed by an organization, I wonder "what if the members of the Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube community banded together to become a Super Representative?" There won't be a seat at the table for any one of us, but perhaps there's one for all of us. Alone we each stand zero chance of winning an election, but together we can vote ourselves in.

Every day these 27 Super Representatives will rotate through producing blocks, and earning the block rewards of 32 TRX per second. That's a little more than 2,750,000 TRX per day at an average of about 100,000 TRX per Super Representative. The bigger Super Representative organizations own enough TRX to vote themselves to the position. The smaller Super Representatives must work a little harder for the votes.

In addition to benefitting the Tron community with support initiatives, a Super Representative may wish to share its rewards directly with the TRX voters who elect it every day. 

My proposal is to create a TRX-20 token, the TRON Groupsource Node Token (TGNT).

Please take a moment to review our [Rewards Proposal](https://github.com/bondibox/community-node/tree/master/executive/rewards_plan.md).

As principals of the TGNT organization, TGNT owners will have voting rights. The primary question for token referendums will be the amount of rewards per rewards tier. While TGNT tokens each represent 1 TRX held in escrow by the organization, and hence one rewarded vote, TGNT will receive a higher payout. 

Voter participation rate will not be 100% among the 65 Billion TRX coin holders. Even for the TRON fanatics, voting every day will become tedious. It might be easier, and more lucrative, for some TRX holders to delegate their votes to an organization who will diligently claim rewards for them by voting daily.

The purpose of TGNT is two fold. First, it accrues TRX coins and subsequently locks in those votes for Super Representative, sparing those TRX owners the need to vote for Super Representative every day. It also gives TRX coin holders a chance to participate in the management of the TRON network. Ownership of TGNT will provide an opportunity for TRX holders to have direct representation with TRON proper. TGNT holders will vote on the issues put forth to their TRON Super Representative, making the process truly democratic.

TGNT will empower token holders with more than just the management of the organization. One of the roles of Super Representative will be 

>To Influence Up to Date and Applicable Business Direction Decisions

Questions facing the Super Representative could be:

> Ecosystem fee and block verification processes  
> Possible Project Partners or Vote for Partnership  
> Intended Market Demographics, Industries for Expansion    
> Changes to Protocol Specific Policy, Procedure or Technology    
> Updates or Creation of Bounties, Campaigns or Incentives  
  
Token holders will participate in quarterly elections to select corporate officers and the Board of Directors. The executives of the organization (President, CEO, CTO, CFO) along with the board of directors will directly hire the remaining staff, including a clear line of succession for system administrators. There will be 2 SysAdmins at all times. This will be a 24/7/365 full time job and pay ought to be commensurate with the growing responsibility.

Management of the server will begin as a volunteer position and will initially be left to me. I will accept open source contributions, because I know what I'm doing but I don't know everything. I have a plan to scale the server size according to its growing predominance, and have already increased the provisioning twice. I am paying out of pocket for the server's introductory level operation. Any additional costs will be borne by Super Representative rewards.

The organization has two financial responsibilities. Primarily it must maintain a reliable Full Node on the TRON blockchain. The secondary responsibility is to reward its supporters. Therefore, the cost of running the server for two months will be paid before any rewards are disbursed.

Just one day of earning would fund a month at my proposed Level III configuration, thus making the server financially self sufficient. As expenses are met, rewards will increase until the commencement of Stage II: The server's technical migration to 16, 32, and finally 64 Core server that meets Tron's recommended configuration to put my node on a level with the top of the heap, at which point expenses will plateau and rewards become consistent.

When the Organization officially launches with the issuance of TGNT, all of the accrued expenses will be sold to the organization in exchange for earned TRX with which I plan to buy TGNT.

If the organization wants to pull an Apple computer on me and say that the guy who built it sucks and you think you can do better, then I can be removed from the project. Hopefully by that time I will have earned enough TGNT tokens that my residual income makes all of my setup effort worthwhile.
